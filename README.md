# sunshine
A parameterized design tool for creating a 3d printable sun.

The file `primary.js` and `stl.js` are derivative works of Apache-2.0 licensed code by 
(Reza Ali) [https://www.syedrezaali.com/ycam-grp/] and

The file `trackball.js` is a derivative work of old Apple sample code `GLSLEditorSample` that was released under a license that did not require attribution if the code was modified. The source is no longer available online but I will find the original and post it soon.
