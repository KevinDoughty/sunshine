	   encloses the 3D view.  You roll this pretend ball with the mouse.  For
	   example, if you click on the center of the ball and move the mouse straight
	   to the right, you roll the ball around its Y-axis.  This produces a Y-axis
	   rotation.  You can click on the "edge" of the ball and roll it around
	   in a circle to get a Z-axis rotation.
	   
	   The math behind the trackball is simple: start with a vector from the first
	   mouse-click on the ball to the center of the 3D view.  At the same time, set the radius
	   of the ball to be the smaller dimension of the 3D view.  As you drag the mouse
	   around in the 3D view, a second vector is computed from the surface of the ball
	   to the center.  The axis of rotation is the cross product of these two vectors,
	   and the angle of rotation is the angle between the two vectors.
